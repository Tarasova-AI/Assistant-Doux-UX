# Designing for Calm: Multilingual, Neutral, and Stress-Aware Language
*Why words matter in pediatric UX — especially under pressure*

---

### 🗣️ Multilingual design from day one

The prototype was created in **French, English, and Russian** simultaneously — not translated afterward.

Each version was:
- **Semantically localized** (not literal)
- **Culturally adapted** for tone and phrasing
- **Balanced** in terms of token length and user reading load

This ensures:
- Equal clarity across languages
- Inclusion of international families
- Less burden on hospital staff to interpret or repeat

### 💬 Tone of voice strategy

- **Neutral but human** — avoids sounding robotic
- **Supportive, not diagnostic** — never prescribes, always invites reflection
- **Short and modular** — works well under cognitive pressure

### 🚫 Language we avoid

| Problematic phrasing                      | Replaced with…                                   |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| "This is not an emergency"               | "None of the worrying signs were selected"       |
| "You should go to…"                      | "You may want to consider…"                      |
| "No symptoms present"                    | "You didn’t check any symptoms — is that right?" |
| "Please describe in detail"              | "What do you observe about your child?"          |

### 🧠 Cognitive accessibility principles

- No long paragraphs
- One question per screen
- No medical jargon
- Color-coded progression (Q1 → Q2 → Q3)
- Predictable UI (every language uses the same logic flow)

---

### 💡 Why it matters

When under stress:
- Reading slows down by up to 40%
- Emotional tone shapes perception of risk
- Blame or ambiguity can trigger avoidance or panic

The right tone = better data, safer decisions, and less pressure on emergency staff.

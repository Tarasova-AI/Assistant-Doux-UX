### 👪 Who is the user?

### 😟 What are they feeling?

- Fear of missing something serious
- Shame about “wasting time” at the hospital
- Overwhelm from complex instructions or long wait times
- Frustration from not understanding medical terms

### 🗺️ UX journey summary

The Assistant is designed not as a form — but as a **companion**.

It leads the user through short, conditional steps that:
- Encourage active reflection
- Avoid forced input when unsure
- Provide contextual validation to reduce stress

Every click is a micro-decision.
The goal is to help the parent breathe, think, and orient — even before seeing a doctor.

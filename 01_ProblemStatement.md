# The Problem: Pediatric Emergency Overload
*A context of system pressure, user confusion, and communication breakdown*

---

### 🚨 Context

Pediatric emergency services in France — and increasingly worldwide — face growing overload due to:

- Staff shortages in hospitals
- High number of non-urgent cases
- Long wait times causing stress and disorganization

Medical teams must not only handle critical emergencies, but also support overwhelmed families — often under extreme cognitive and emotional load.

### 👪 The Parent's Experience

Many parents:
- Feel lost and anxious
- Can’t reliably evaluate symptoms
- Come to the ER “just in case”

This contributes — unintentionally — to congestion.

Especially for **non-native speakers**, communication becomes even harder, extending interactions and increasing stress on both sides.

### 📊 Problem by the numbers

> Up to **30%** of pediatric ER visits are not medically urgent.  
> Staff are under-resourced, frequently confronted with repetitive or low-priority questions.  
> Multilingual families face higher risk of misunderstanding and miscommunication.

### 🎯 Why this is a UX-critical issue

When a system is overloaded:
- The most vulnerable users make the most preventable errors
- Professionals spend more time managing stress than providing care
- Small UX changes can have life-saving ripple effects

> **Reducing noise** in the triage process is not just an optimization — it's a public health priority.

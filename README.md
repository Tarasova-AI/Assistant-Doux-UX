# Assistant Doux (UX)  
*A multilingual, stress-aware prototype to reduce pediatric ER overload*

---

## 🎯 What is this?

**Assistant Doux** is an interactive UX prototype designed to support pediatric emergency departments by:

- Guiding families through self-assessment under stress  
- Reducing non-urgent ER visits with clarity, not guilt  
- Operating in **French, English, and Russian**  
- Requiring no login, installation, or data collection

This is a **UX-first, no-code, multilingual prototype**, ready to test in real-world scenarios.

## 🧠 Why it matters

Pediatric ERs are overwhelmed — up to 30% of visits are not medically urgent.  
Parents are confused, often stressed or misinformed. Staff are under pressure.

This tool helps:

- Reduce staff overload  
- Empower families to act early  
- Improve multilingual access and triage
